# Hello-World
My practice repository. where I will be putting up most of my initial learning python codes
Hi developers here!

I'm Florence. I prefer to be called FAE. My first and thus favorite language is python. I have been learning python for a while now. at a very slow pace. but i am happy about the possibilities
sometimes i wonder if I'm doing the right thing spending so much time here.
